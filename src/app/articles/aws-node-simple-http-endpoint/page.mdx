As a backend developer one of the most common tasks you will be asked to do is create a HTTP endpoint to execute some code.

This example shows you the simplest way that you can possibly do that.

It takes a single node function and deploys it to AWS as a Lambda. The stack will output a function URL where you can run it.

Before continuing, if you are unfamiliar with AWS CDK I do recommend reading [What is AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) first.

## In this example we

- Create a Node.js Lambda function using AWS CDK.
- Configure the runtime version and entry point for the Lambda function.
- Deploy the Lambda function to AWS.
- Generate an HTTP endpoint URL for the Lambda function.
- Output the URL of the Lambda function as a CloudFormation output for easy access.
- Test the Lambda using curl.

## Getting started

To get started pull down the code for this example from [GitHub](https://github.com/backendmentor-io/examples/tree/main/aws-node-simple-http-endpoint) and open it in your favourite IDE.

## Code



## Walkthrough

### First we define our Lambda Function construct (`myLambda`) in the `stack.ts` file

```typescript
const myLambda = new NodejsFunction(this, 'MyLambda', {
      runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      entry: './lib/handler.js',
      handler: 'handler',
    });
```

- To define our function we use the `NodejsFunction` [construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs.NodejsFunction.html). This is a [higher-level construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html) specifically to be used with Node functions.
- The Lambda function can be configured to use any supported Node.js runtime. In this case I am using `runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_16_X`.
- Finally we configure the entry file location at `./lib/handler.js`, and the `handler` function to be used as the entry point.
- You will note that in this example we don't use TypeScript, it's just plain old JavaScript to keep things as simple as possible.

### Lets review the application code in the `handler.js` file

```javascript
export const handler = async (event) => {
  // Your logic goes here...

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from Lambda!' }),
  };
};
```

- This is our application code. We can do whatever we want here in response to the HTTP request.
- The function defined as an asynchronous arrow function. It is possible to use [callbacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html#nodejs-handler-callback) but not recommended.
- It receives the [event param](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-event) with details of what triggered the function.
- From the function we simply return the response object with statusCode 200 and a JSON stringified body containing a message.

### Adding a Function URL to the Lambda function

```typescript
const lambdaUrl = myLambda.addFunctionUrl({
      authType: FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE,
    });
```

- AWS Lambdas offer a [built-in HTTPS endpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-lambda-function-urls-built-in-https-endpoints-for-single-function-microservices/) for single function services.
- The Lambda function is configured to generate a function URL using the `addFunctionUrl` method.
- We don't need any authentication so the `authType` is set to `FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE`.

### Getting the URL output

```typescript
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'LambdaEndpoint', {
      value: lambdaUrl.url,
      description: 'Lambda function endpoint URL',
    });
```

- The generated URL of the Lambda function (`lambdaUrl.url`) is outputted as a CloudFormation output (`LambdaEndpoint`).
- This URL serves as the HTTP endpoint for invoking the Lambda function directly.

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can deploy the Lambda function using AWS CDK:

```bash
cdk deploy
```

After deployment, the CloudFormation stack outputs will include the Lambda function's endpoint URL. You can use this URL for testing your Lambda function.

## Testing Lambda Output with curl

To test the Lambda function's output using curl, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Lambda function's endpoint URL from the CloudFormation stack outputs.

2. Use curl to send a GET request to the Lambda endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET <lambda-endpoint-url>
   ```

   Replace `<lambda-endpoint-url>` with the actual Lambda function's endpoint URL.

3. You should receive a response from the Lambda function similar to the following:

   ```json
   { "message": "Hello from Lambda!" }
   ```

   This confirms that the Lambda function is working correctly.
